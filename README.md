# Forum
A basic school project that consists of implementing a forum using C.


A discussion forum is comprised of a set of sections. Within each section, messages are posted. A message can be a response to another message or the initiator of a series of responses. Messages are written by authors, who can either be transient visitors to the forum site or identified authors with associated profiles. A forum is characterized by its internet address and the email address of its administrator. A section is described by the theme it addresses, its creation date, and the email address of its moderator. Additionally, we would like to associate a list of websites related to a section. A message consists of a title, text, and its publication date. If a message is posted in response to another, this information must be stored. A message is posted by a single author, but the same author can publish multiple messages. An author of a message is described by a username, the date of the first posted message, the date of the last posted message, and the number of messages posted. A profile is the description of a person registered on the forum, with a registration number. We want to know their first name, last name, address, date of birth, email address, and phone number.
